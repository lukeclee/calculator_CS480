# calculator_CS480
This is a calculator app that I am developing for my CS 480 class

Added actionlistener and functionality some of the buttons

Added the actual calculations part when the user hit the "=" button
as well as almost all button functionality
Also added error handling like an uneven amount of parenthesis or divide by zero
