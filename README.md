# calculator_CS480
This is a calculator app that I am developing for my CS 480 class

Added actionlistener and functionality some of the buttons

Added the actual calculations part when the user hit the "=" button
as well as almost all button functionality
Also added error handling like an uneven amount of parenthesis or divide by zero

Put the calculating part into its own method and finished adding the button functionality. 
Added a part to the calculation function that handles the errors I did not set up an if statement for.

I used a javascript to evaluate the expression that is passed by the user through the calculator.
If I had more time I would implement my own evaluation function.

Also the only error handling that I did not take care of to the fullest extent was if an operator doesn't 
have two operands associated with it.
